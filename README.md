**What is Conway's Game of Life?**

Please see my associated [blog post](http://seesharpdeveloper.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/conways-game-of-life-exercise-in-wpf.html) or the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

**What is this implementation built with?**

This implementation is built using .NET Framework version 4.5.2, C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. I used Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

**Why?**

I was inspired by Lea Verou's play-by-play Pluralsight video on implementing Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript (with HTML/CSS) and thought it would be a fun exercise in C# and WPF.
