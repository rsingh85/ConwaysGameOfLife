# ConwaysGameOfLife
A C# with WPF implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life algorithm.

WHAT IS CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE?
  The Wikipedia article on it is a good start :)

WHAT'S IT BUILT ON?
  This implementation is built on the .NET Framework version 4.5.2 with C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. I used Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
