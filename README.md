# ConwaysGameOfLife
A C# with WPF implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life algorithm.

**What is Conway's Game of Life?**

The Wikipedia article on it is a good start :)

**What is this implementation built with?**

This implementation is built on the .NET Framework version 4.5.2 with C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. I used Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

**Why?**

I was inspired by Lea Verou's play-by-play Pluralsight video on implementing the Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript (with HTML/CSS) and thought it would be a fun Sunday exercise.
